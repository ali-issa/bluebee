          <p>
            This document informs Users about the technologies that help this Application to achieve
            the purposes described below. Such technologies allow the Owner to access and store
            information (for example by using a Cookie) or use resources (for example by running a
            script) on a User’s device as they interact with this Application.
          </p>
          <p>
            For simplicity, all such technologies are defined as &quot;Trackers&quot; within this
            document – unless there is a reason to differentiate.
            <br />
            For example, while Cookies can be used on both web and mobile browsers, it would be
            inaccurate to talk about Cookies in the context of mobile apps as they are a
            browser-based Tracker. For this reason, within this document, the term Cookies is only
            used where it is specifically meant to indicate that particular type of Tracker.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some of the purposes for which Trackers are used may also require the User&apos;s
            consent. Whenever consent is given, it can be freely withdrawn at any time following the
            instructions provided in this document.
          </p>

          <p>
            This Application uses Trackers managed directly by the Owner (so-called “first-party”
            Trackers) and Trackers that enable services provided by a third-party (so-called
            “third-party” Trackers). Unless otherwise specified within this document, third-party
            providers may access the Trackers managed by them.
            <br />
            The validity and expiration periods of Cookies and other similar Trackers may vary
            depending on the lifetime set by the Owner or the relevant provider. Some of them expire
            upon termination of the User’s browsing session.
            <br />
            In addition to what’s specified in the descriptions within each of the categories below,
            Users may find more precise and updated information regarding lifetime specification as
            well as any other relevant information — such as the presence of other Trackers — in the
            linked privacy policies of the respective third-party providers or by contacting the
            Owner.

          <h4>Consequences of denying the use of Trackers</h4>
          <p>
            Users are free to decide whether or not to allow the use of Trackers. However, please
            note that Trackers help this Application to provide a better experience and advanced
            functionalities to Users (in line with the purposes outlined in this document).
            Therefore, if the User chooses to block the use of Trackers, the Owner may be unable to
            provide related features.
